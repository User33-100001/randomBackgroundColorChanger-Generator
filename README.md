# randomBackgroundColorChanger-Generator

Hello Guys.

I have created this generator with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Here a random string generator function is created which generate random strings of hex value #00000 which ranges from 0 to 9 and A to F.
The background is changed with the help of DOM manipulation and onClick function.
